Task:
    Define a class Employee with the following information:
    name, salary, position, department, email, and age. The
    name, salary, position, and department are mandatory, while the rest are optional.
    Your task is to write a program that takes N lines of employees
    from the console and calculates the department with
    the highest average salary, and prints for each employee in that department
    his name, salary, email, and age –
    sorted by salary in descending order. If an employee doesn't have an email –
    in place of that field, you should print
    "n/a" instead, if he doesn't have an age – print "-1" instead.
    The salary should be printed in two decimal places
    after the separator.
Hint:
    you can define a Department class with a list of employees.
