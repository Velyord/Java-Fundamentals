Task:
    It's time for teamwork projects, and you are responsible for making the teams.
    First, you will receive an integer - the
    count of the teams you will have to register.
    You will be given a user and a team (separated with "-"). The user is
    the creator of that team.
    For every newly created team, you should print a message:
    "Team {team Name} has been created by {user}!"
    Next, you will receive a user with the team (separated with "->")
    which means that the user wants to join that team.
    Upon receiving the command: "end of assignment", you should print every team,
    ordered by the count of its
    members (descending) and then by name (ascending).
    For each team (disband teams as well), you have to print its
    members sorted by name (ascending). However, there are several rules:
    • If a user tries to create a team more than once, a message should be displayed:
        "Team {teamName} was already created!"
    • The creator of a team cannot create another team - the message should be thrown:
        "{user} cannot create another team!"
    • If a user tries to join a currently non-existing team, a message should be displayed:
        "Team {teamName} does not exist!"
    • A Member of a team cannot join another team - the message should be thrown:
        "Member {user} cannot join team {team Name}!"
    • At the end (after teams' report), teams with zero members (with only a creator) should disband,
    ordered by name in ascending other.
    • Every valid team should be printed ordered by name (ascending) in this format:
        "{teamName}:
        - {create}
        -- {member}..."
Examples:

    Didy-PowerPuffsCoders
    Tony-Tony is the best
    Petya->PowerPuffsCoders
    Tony->Tony is the best
    end of assignment
    ->
    Team PowerPuffsCoders has been
    created by Didy!
    Team Tony is the best has been
    created by Tony!
    Member Tony cannot join team
    Tony is the best!
    PowerPuffsCoders
    - Didy
    -- Petya
    Teams to disband:
    Tony is the best
        Tony created a team that he tried
        later to join. So the message was
        shown. Since no one is trying to join
        his team, the team has to disband.

    Tatyana-CloneClub
    Helena-CloneClub
    Trifon-BRBClub
    Peter->bRBClub
    Peter->BRBClub
    Tatyana->Leda
    Petter->BRBClub
    Cossima->CloneClub
    end of assignment
    ->
    Team CloneClub has been created
    by Tatyana!
    Team CloneClub was already
    created!
    Team BRBClub has been created by
    Trifon!
    Team bRBClub does not exist!
    Team Leda does not exist!
    BRBClub
    - Trifon
    -- Peter
    -- Petter
    CloneClub
    - Tatyana
    -- Cossima
    Teams to disband:
        Note that when you join a team,
        you should check first if it exists,
        then check if the user is already in a
        team:
        Tatyana has created CloneClub, and
        then she tries to join a non-existing
        team – so a message for the nonexisting team is shown.
